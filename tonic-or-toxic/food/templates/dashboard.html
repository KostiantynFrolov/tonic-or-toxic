    <p class="long-text">Our website's "Tonic or Toxic" rating system for harmful additives provides users
        with valuable insights into the safety of various ingredients. Utilizing a comprehensive
        approach, we base our ratings on a meticulous review of scientific evidence sourced from
        esteemed peer-reviewed literature, alongside data from authoritative entities like
        the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),
        and the World Health Organization (WHO). This thorough examination encompasses toxicological,
        epidemiological, and exposure data, ensuring a holistic understanding of each additive's
        potential impact on health. Additionally, we consider factors such as data reliability,
        uncertainties, and the additive's benefits, while also recognizing the unique
        vulnerabilities of certain groups, such as children or pregnant individuals. By synthesizing this
        wealth of information, our rating system aims to empower users to make informed choices about
        the substances they consume, promoting a healthier and safer lifestyle.</p>
