## General info
This is my final project for the Python Developer course at Coders Lab.
The innovative application assists users in selecting healthy foods.
Unlike other apps, this one stands out by analyzing food safety using a database of food additives, not just products.
The application offers single and multi-name searches, as well as a photo-based check feature.
It enhances user convenience and promotes healthier eating habits.

* Python 3.8
* Django 4.2.11
